<h2 color="blue">The aim of the project</h2>
**-📁 Creating a simple game:**

I created a pawn game in console mode with a simple and intuitive user interface. The game consisted of applying my knowledge of C languages.

**-👀 Design choices:**

I focused on ease of use and speed of learning to make the game accessible to everyone. The functionalities and game mechanics have been deliberately simplified to suit a first project in C.

**-🧾C language skills:**

I used the basic notions of the C language, such as variables, data types, control structures (conditional, loops) and functions.

This project allowed me to develop my skills in :

Procedural programming
Memory management
Debugging and error correction


**-🤔 This project enabled me to:**

Develop my autonomy and problem-solving skills<br>
Appreciate the importance of documentation and testing</br>
Feel the satisfaction of completing a project from start to finish</br>
